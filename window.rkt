#| Ideas
- sawfish/src/functions.c
- The best and simplest way may be to consider one desktop per monitor.
  (this however requires to resize the windows and positions according to each monitor?)
- to test monitors on a single screen, I could set up "virtual" monitors, 
  i.e., split the screen in different monitors.
  This could even be a usefull feature (to develop further and expand?)
- each monitor may display a different workspace (like xmonad)
- These should be done as extensions to RWind, not in the core
- use xinerama?
