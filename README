                           The Racket Window Manager

An extensible window manager aiming to be similar to Sawfish 
(http://sawfish.wikia.com), but written in the Racket programming language 
(http://www.racket-lang.org).

Warning: This package is under current development and is in no way stable.

Current features:
-----------------
  - very little
  - a client command line
  - customization of key bindings and mouse bindings
  - no frames

Installation:
-------------
1) Install Racket: http://www.racket-lang.org

2) Create a directory where to place Racket projects (e.g., 
/home/me/Programming/Racket), then do:

  git clone http://github.com/kazzmir/x11-racket.git
  git clone http://github.com/Metaxal/RWind.git
  raco link x11-racket rwind
  raco setup x11-racket rwind

3) Copy the provided .xinitrc-rwind file in your home directory, and modify its
contents according to your installation.

4) Optional, but recommended:

Copy (or link) the file user-script-examples/me.rkt to 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rwind/config.rkt (or to $HOME/.config/rwind/config.rkt if the
xdg environment variable is not set).

It defines a number of default key and mouse bindings.
 - Control-left-button to move a window around
 - Control-right-button to resize the window

5) In a login shell, type the following:

  xinit .xinitrc-rwind -- :1 &

You may need to modify the display ":1" to ":2" for example if ":1" is not 
available.

Press Alt-Escape to quit the session.

Installation for use in lightdm/gdm:
------------------------------------

1) In rwind directory, compile and install the executable with:

  raco exe rwind.rkt && sudo cp rwind /usr/bin

2) Copy the provided file rwind.desktop to /usr/share/xsessions/rwind.desktop
