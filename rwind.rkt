#| TODO:
PRIORITIES:
- *** make the basis so that extending and debugging is easy! ***
- make sure Racket's GUI works... (problems with the event-spaces)

Other:
- security of the server: make sure the user at the other end of the tcp connection
  is the same as the one running the server!
  Use Unix uid's? ask for password?

- (select-window)
  plus look at all the window utilities in Sawfish (lisp/sawfish/wm/windows.jl)
- shutdown more gracefully?
- time-stamps are quite probably not handled properly

- viewports?

- GUI. Started, but problem, conflict with Racket's gui?

- grab the server here and there to speed up things
  Warning: Beware of deadlocks, especially with the gui thread

- Planet 2 packaging

- compilation and launch:
X11_RACKET_DEBUG=1 raco setup x11 rwind && xinit .xinit-rwind -- :1 &

- In rwind's directory: raco link rwind
to be able to use (require rwind/keymap) for example
(optional: raco setup rwind)

- After trying hard to use threads (and failing) with Xlib, it seems anyway that it's better to not use them at all.
  It's of no use of the user's script, and the client may be better off in a separate application.
  Sawfish does not seem to use XInitThreads() either.
